A simple free and open-source [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) editor. JetUML supports sketching software design ideas quickly and with a minimum of hassle. Diagrams can be exported to popular image formats and copied to the system clipboard for integration with other tools.
