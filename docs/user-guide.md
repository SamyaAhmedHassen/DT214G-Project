# JetUML User Guide

For JetUML Version 3.9. Updated 2025-08-24.

## Main Features

The essential features of JetUML. 

1. **Automatic Edge Layout.** JetUML automatically lays out the edges that represent association between elements. The paths are computed using custom algorithms intended to give the diagrams a clean and natural look. To change the path of an edge, simply move the nodes around. 

2. **Five Diagram Types.** JetUML currently supports [class diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram), [sequence diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram), [state diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine), [object diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_diagram), and [use case diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case_diagram). (See the menu  _File | New_)

3. **Semantic Diagram Validation.** When creating a diagram, JetUML checks to ensure that the diagram is valid and reports problems using pop-up notifications.

4. **Copy to Clipboard.** With a single command, copy the current diagram to the clipboard without the background grid, and with just the right bounding box. The diagram can then easily be pasted into chat programs, slide presentations, etc. (_File | Copy to Clipboard_)

5. **Export to Image File.** Export a diagram to an image file. Supported formats include [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG), [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG), [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG), and more. (_File | Export Image_)

6. **Duplicate Diagram.** With a single command, duplicate the current diagram to explore different design alternatives. (_File | Duplicate_)

7. **Customizable Interface.** View additional hints and documentation directly in the user interface, switch to dark mode, change the font, hide the grid, etc. See the View menu for all the customization options. (See the _View_ menu)

8. **Open file format.** JetUML saves diagram in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files using a [documented format](schemas.md). Diagrams can thus be accessed and manipulated outside of JetUML. (_File | Save_)
